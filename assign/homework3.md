### Chapter 4 Homework

### Problem 1 (10 pts)
What is the difference between routing and forwarding?

### Problem 2 (10 pts)
What is the role of the forwarding table within a router?

### Problem 3 (10 pts)
Describe why each _input_ port in a high-speed router stores a shadow copy of the forwarding table.

### Problem 4 (10 pts)
What is HOL blocking? Does it occur in input ports or output ports?

### Problem 5 (10 pts)
Visit a host that uses DHCP to obtain its IP address, network mask, default router, and IP address of its local DNS server. List these values.

### Problem 6 (10 pts)
Suppose Host A sends Host B a TCP segment encapsulated in an IP datagram. When Host B receives the datagram, how does the network layer in Host B know it should pass the segment (that is, the payload of the datagram) to TCP rather than to UDP or to something else?

### Problem 7 (10 pts)
Compare and contrast the IPv4 and the IPv6 header fields. Do they have any fields in common?

### Problem 8 (10 pts)
Consider sending a 2400-byte datagram into a link that has an MTU of 700 bytes. Suppose the original datagram is stamped with the identification number 422. How many fragments are generated? What are the values in the various fields in the IP datagram(s) generated related to fragmentation?

### Problem 9 (20 pts)
Consider a router that interconnects three subnets: Subnet 1, Subnet 2, and Subnet 3. Suppose all of the interfaces in each of these three subnets are required to have the prefix 223.1.17/24. Also suppose that Subnet 1 is required to support at least 60 interfaces, Subnet 2 is to support at least 90 interfaces, and Subnet 3 is to support at least 12 interfaces. Provide three network addresses (of the form a.b.c.d/x) that satisfy these constraints.
