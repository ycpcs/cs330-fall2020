# Chapter 2 Homework

### R6 (10 pts).
Suppose you wanted to do a transaction from a remote client to a server as fast as possible. Would you use UDP or TCP? Why?

### R12 (15 pts).
Consider an e-commerce site that wants to keep a purchase record for each of its customers. Describe how this can be done with cookies.

### R19 (15 pts).
Is it possible for an organizationâ€™s Web server and mail server to have exactly the same alias for a hostname (for example, _foo.com_)? What would be the type for the RR that contains the hostname of the mail server?

### R26 (15 pts).
In Section 2.7, the UDP server described needed only one socket, whereas the TCP server needed two sockets. Why? If the TCP server were to support _n_ simultaneous connections, each from a different client host, how many sockets would the TCP server need?

### P3 (15 pts).
Consider an HTTP client that wants to retrieve a Web document at a given URL. The IP address of the HTTP server is initially unknown. What transport and application-layer protocols besides HTTP are needed in this scenario?

### P20 (15 pts).
Suppose you can access the caches in the local DNS servers of your department. Can you propose a way to roughly determine the Web servers (outside your department) that are most popular among the users in your department? Explain.

### P22 (15 pts).
Consider distributing a file of _F =_ 15 Gbits to _N_ peers. The server has an upload rate of _u<sub>s</sub>_ = 30 Mbps, and each peer has a download rate of _d<sub>i</sub>_ = 2 Mbps and an upload rate of _u_.
For _N_ = 10, 100, and 1,000 and _u_ = 300 Kbps, 700 Kbps, and 2 Mbps, prepare a **chart** giving the minimum distribution time for each of the combinations of _N_ and _u_ for both client-server distribution and P2P distribution.
